### Based on PPP
 https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/india/ppp-conversion-factor  
 
 Assuming that USD $1 million is good enough to retire in US. (cash + investments. Not including the value of residing house)  
 PPP in 2018 was 18.  
 The amount required to retire in india in 2018 is 1.8cr Rs.  
 Which translates to 400k SGD cash + investments (Without any debt obligation, rent, school expenses etc. Just simple food , transport and other living expenses )  
 
 ### Three percent yearly expense drawn
 For early retirement, you can draw 3% every year to beat inflation. (Check out the average inflation rate for past 5 years)  
 3% of 400k$ = 12K/Year. Means around 1K SGD per month (@2020).  Which seems like decent living expense (without any loans and rents)

### 2025 Version

### üßÆ 2025 Retirement Corpus and Drawdown (3% Rule)

| Country            | Adjusted Corpus (2025) | 3% Drawdown / Year | 3% Drawdown / Month | Notes                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| üá∫üá∏ United States | **USD 1.29 million**   | **USD 38,700**     | **USD 3,225**       | Modest lifestyle in low-cost US regions       |
| üáÆüá≥ India         | **‚Çπ2.74 crore**        | **‚Çπ8.22 lakh**     | **‚Çπ68,500**         | Decent lifestyle, no rent, in Tier-2/3 cities |
| üá∏üá¨ Singapore     | **SGD 468,000**        | **SGD 14,040**     | **SGD 1,170**       | Decent lifestyle, no rent                     |


Let's update your retirement cost analysis to **2025** with revised figures, adjusting for:

1. **Inflation in India and Singapore**
2. **Changes in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**
3. **Investment growth assumptions (if any)**
4. **Consistency of lifestyle assumptions (no rent, no debt)**

## Calulation to adjust to year 2025

### üî¢ Original Assumptions (2018)

| Metric                      | Value           |
| --------------------------- | --------------- |
| US retirement corpus        | USD \$1 million |
| PPP (India\:US)             | 18              |
| Equivalent INR corpus (PPP) | ‚Çπ1.8 crore      |
| SGD corpus for India        | SGD 400k        |
| Annual drawdown rate        | 3%              |
| Monthly drawdown (2020)     | SGD 1,000       |

### üîÅ 2025 Adjusted Assumptions

#### 1. **Inflation Adjustments (2018‚Äì2025, cumulative over 7 years)**

| Country   | Avg. Annual Inflation | Cumulative Inflation (7 yrs) | Source-based Estimate |
| --------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| India     | \~5.5%                | \~52%                        | RBI, IMF estimates    |
| Singapore | \~2.2%                | \~17%                        | MAS data              |
| US        | \~3.5%                | \~29%                        | Fed + BLS estimates   |

Let‚Äôs apply inflation to your 2018 values:

#### 2. **India Retirement Corpus (Inflation Adjusted)**

* ‚Çπ1.8 crore in 2018
* Adjusted to 2025:
  ‚Çπ1.8 crore √ó 1.52 = **‚Çπ2.74 crore**

#### 3. **SGD Corpus Required (Inflation Adjusted)**

* SGD 400k √ó 1.17 = **SGD 468k**
  (Same standard of living in 2025)

#### 4. **Monthly Drawdown @ 3% Rule**

* 3% of SGD 468k = **SGD 14,040/year**
* Which means: **SGD 1,170/month**

This still assumes:

* No housing/rent cost
* No significant medical or lifestyle shocks
* Conservative investment (not drawing down principal aggressively)

### üßÆ Updated Summary for 2025

| Metric                         | Value (2025 adjusted) |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| US Retirement Corpus           | USD 1.29 million      |
| India Corpus Needed            | ‚Çπ2.74 crore           |
| SGD Corpus Needed (India life) | SGD 468,000           |
| Monthly Expenses (3% drawdown) | SGD 1,170/month       |

### ‚úÖ Final Notes

* These estimates hold if you're targeting a **simple but comfortable lifestyle in India**.
* If your investment returns match or exceed inflation, this plan remains sustainable.
* Add medical inflation buffer if aging or with known health risks.
* Review PPP again if USD-INR rates and inflation diverge significantly.
