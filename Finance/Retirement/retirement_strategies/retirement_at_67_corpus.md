Fidelity's guideline: Aim to save at least  **6x annual salary amount by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67**. (or 1x your salary by 30, 3x by 40,)

**Assumptions**
- a person saves 15% of their income annually beginning at age 25 (which includes any employer match),
- invests more than 50% on average of their savings in stocks over their lifetime, retires at age 67,
- and plans to maintain their preretirement lifestyle in retirement (see footnote 1 for more details).

 
 Aim to save at least 15% of your pre-tax income each year, which includes any employer match. That's assuming you save continuously for retirement from age 25 to age 67. Together with other steps, that should help ensure you have enough income to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement. 

 Not all of that money will need to come from your savings, however. Some will likely come from Social Security. So, we did the math and found that most people will need to generate about 45% of their retirement income (before taxes) from savings. Based on our estimates, saving 15% each year from age 25 to 67 should get you there. If you are lucky enough to have a pension, your target savings rate may be lower.
