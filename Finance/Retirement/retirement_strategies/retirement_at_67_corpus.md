Fidelity's guideline: Aim to save at least  **6x annual salary amount by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67**. (or 1x your salary by 30, 3x by 40,)

**Assumptions**
- a person saves 15% of their income annually beginning at age 25 (which includes any employer match),
- invests more than 50% on average of their savings in stocks over their lifetime, retires at age 67,
- and plans to maintain their preretirement lifestyle in retirement (see footnote 1 for more details).

 
 Aim to save at least 15% of your pre-tax income each year, which includes any employer match. That's assuming you save continuously for retirement from age 25 to age 67. Together with other steps, that should help ensure you have enough income to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement. 

 Not all of that money will need to come from your savings, however. Some will likely come from Social Security. So, we did the math and found that most people will need to generate about 45% of their retirement income (before taxes) from savings. Based on our estimates, saving 15% each year from age 25 to 67 should get you there. If you are lucky enough to have a pension, your target savings rate may be lower.

### Critic
For high income low expense people, instead of this method, you should you multiple of expeneses. Assuming 6x of annual income for these people might be over calculating. 
Calculation based on 25x of annual expenses seems correct.  
However expenses also vary by age. Someone between 30 to 50 will have mortgage , education and other expenses which in retirement is not required.  

Fidelity's 10√ó rule is overkill for high earners with lean retirement goals. Instead:

- Plan around retirement lifestyle expenses
- Allow for age-based expense variation
- Target ~30√ó monthly retirement expenses as a better heuristic than 10√ó salary


## üí° Updated Scenario: Varying Expenses Across Life Stages

| Life Stage   | Age Range | Typical Monthly Expenses (SGD) | Key Cost Drivers                                     |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Early Career | 25‚Äì30     | 3,000                          | Low: Rent, food, transport                           |
| Midlife      | 30‚Äì50     | 6,000‚Äì8,000                    | Mortgage, children, education                        |
| Late Career  | 50‚Äì67     | 4,000‚Äì5,000                    | Fewer dependents, health costs                       |
| Retirement   | 67+       | 3,000‚Äì3,500                    | No rent/mortgage, simpler lifestyle, some healthcare |


## üßÆ Retirement Corpus Estimation (Adjusted)

We focus on retirement **expenses only**. Let‚Äôs say:

* Retirement Monthly Expense Target (no housing, no kids): SGD 3,200
* Annual: SGD 38,400
* Retirement Corpus Needed:

  * **@ 3% rule**: SGD **1.28 million**
  * **@ 4% rule**: SGD **960k**

| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 25‚Äì35     | Save aggressively (20%+) | Low personal expenses, high margin |
| 35‚Äì50     | Balance savings + family | Mortgages + education peak         |
| 50‚Äì60     | Re-accelerate saving     | Expenses drop, income likely peaks |
| 60‚Äì67     | Optimize for drawdown    | Reduce risk, rebalance investments |

## üß† Conclusion

**Fidelity's 10√ó rule is overkill for high earners with lean retirement goals**. Instead:

* Plan around **retirement lifestyle expenses**

* Target **\~30 years of monthly retirement expenses** as a better heuristic than 10√ó salary
