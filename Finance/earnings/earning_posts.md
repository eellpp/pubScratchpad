### 20 years in US and I saved 8M (May 2025)
It would be unimaginable for someone in India with mediocre talent like me to accumulate this much wealth in 20 years. America is still a gold mine for hard working, ready to fight kind of guys even with limited talent. I am now retiring back home and have no worry about financials for many many generations!

TC: 640K (from fixed income and dividends only, no work)

44 years old, used to be Staff level Engineer before laid off, consistent investment in past 20 years
