Estimating the wealth accumulated by someone working in banking or technology in the United States after 20 years depends on factors like their specific role, income growth, savings rate, investment choices, lifestyle, and economic conditions. Below, I’ll provide a reasoned estimate for typical career paths in these sectors, using available data and assumptions grounded in the U.S. context. I’ll also compare this to the Singapore scenario you previously asked about, as requested. All figures are in USD unless otherwise noted.

### Key Factors Influencing Wealth Accumulation in the U.S.
1. **Income Levels**:
   - **Banking**: Salaries vary widely. Junior analysts in investment banking (0–3 years) earn $80k–$120k base salary, with bonuses of 50–100% of base. Associates (3–5 years) earn $125k–$200k, and vice presidents (8–10 years) can earn $200k–$400k, including bonuses. Wealth management associates average $92,801 in 2025, ranging from $78,836 to $109,912, with total cash compensation (including bonuses) averaging $103,580. Senior roles like managing directors in investment banking or private banking can earn $500k–$1M+ annually with bonuses.[](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/recruiting/wealth-management-associate-salary)[](https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2023/03/wall-street-junior-salary)
   - **Technology**: Software engineers start at $80k–$120k in 2025, with median salaries for tech professionals at ~$120k. Senior engineers or specialists (e.g., machine learning, AI) with 15+ years can earn $200k–$400k, especially in high-cost areas like Silicon Valley. Bonuses and stock options (e.g., RSUs) can add 20–50% or more to total compensation, particularly at tech giants like Google or Microsoft.[](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/19/17370288/silicon-valley-how-many-billionaires-start-up-tech-bay-area)
   - **Salary Growth**: Assume 4–5% annual growth for both sectors, reflecting promotions and market demand. Top performers in banking or tech may see faster growth due to bonuses or equity.

2. **Savings Rate**:
   - U.S. professionals face high living costs, especially in cities like New York or San Francisco. A savings rate of 20–40% is reasonable for high earners, though lifestyle inflation (e.g., housing, education, luxury spending) can reduce this.

3. **Investments**:
   - Wealth growth depends on investment returns. U.S. stock markets (e.g., S&P 500) historically yield 7–10% annualized returns (before inflation). Real estate, 401(k) plans, and other assets also contribute. Unlike Singapore’s CPF, the U.S. relies on 401(k)s (with employer matching) and IRAs, which grow tax-advantaged but depend on individual contributions.

4. **Housing and Liabilities**:
   - Homeownership is common, but U.S. housing costs vary (e.g., median home price in 2025: ~$420k nationally, $800k–$1.5M in high-cost areas). Mortgages are a significant liability, but home equity builds wealth if property appreciates.[](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/what-is-the-average-american-net-worth-by-age)
   - Student loans or credit card debt can reduce net worth, especially early in careers.

5. **Taxes**:
   - U.S. federal and state taxes (20–35% effective rate for high earners) reduce take-home pay compared to Singapore’s lower tax rates (7–15%). Capital gains taxes (15–20%) also apply to investments.

6. **Lifestyle and Expenses**:
   - High earners in the U.S. often face pressure to spend on housing, education, and healthcare. Frugal professionals or those without dependents save more.

### Estimating Wealth After 20 Years in the U.S.
Let’s model two scenarios for a professional starting in 2005 and working until 2025, one in banking and one in technology, with conservative assumptions.

#### Scenario 1: Banking Professional (e.g., Investment Banker or Wealth Manager)
- **Starting Salary (2005)**: $70k/year (junior analyst), typical for investment banking or wealth management roles.
- **Salary Growth**: 5% annual growth, reflecting promotions. By 2025, salary reaches ~$190k/year. Bonuses (20–50% of base) add ~$40k/year by 2025. Total compensation: ~$230k/year.
- **Total Income (20 years)**: With 5% growth and bonuses, gross income is ~$3.2M. After taxes (~25% effective rate), take-home pay is ~$2.4M.
- **Savings Rate**: Assume 30% savings rate ($720k saved), accounting for high living costs in cities like New York.
- **401(k) Contributions**: Assume $10k/year contributions (including employer match) for 20 years, growing at 7% annually (stock-heavy portfolio). This yields ~$440k by 2025.
- **Investments**: Assume $360k of non-401(k) savings invested at 7% returns (e.g., S&P 500). Compounded over 20 years, this grows to ~$1.39M.
- **Housing**: Assume a $500k home purchased in 2015 (financed with a 30-year mortgage). By 2025, home value appreciates to ~$750k (4% annual growth), with ~$350k mortgage debt remaining. Equity: ~$400k.
- **Total Wealth**:
  - Liquid assets: $1.39M (investments) + $440k (401(k)) = $1.83M
  - Home equity: $400k
  - Total net worth: ~$2.23M
- **Debt**: Assume minimal non-mortgage debt (e.g., student loans paid off early).

#### Scenario 2: Technology Professional (e.g., Software Engineer)
- **Starting Salary (2005)**: $65k/year, typical for a junior software engineer.
- **Salary Growth**: 4% annual growth, reaching ~$150k/year by 2025. Stock options/bonuses add ~15% ($22k/year). Total compensation: ~$172k/year.
- **Total Income (20 years)**: With 4% growth and bonuses, gross income is ~$2.4M. After taxes (~25%), take-home pay is ~$1.8M.
- **Savings Rate**: Assume 35% savings rate ($630k saved), as tech professionals may have slightly lower lifestyle costs than bankers.
- **401(k) Contributions**: $10k/year for 20 years at 7% returns yields ~$440k.
- **Investments**: Assume $315k of non-401(k) savings invested at 7%, growing to ~$1.22M.
- **Housing**: Same home purchase ($500k in 2015, $750k in 2025, $400k equity).
- **Total Wealth**:
  - Liquid assets: $1.22M (investments) + $440k (401(k)) = $1.66M
  - Home equity: $400k
  - Total net worth: ~$2.06M
- **Debt**: Assume minimal non-mortgage debt.

### Comparison to Singapore
Using the Singapore estimates from your previous query:
- **Banking Professional**: S$1.66M–S$1.86M (~$1.24M–$1.39M USD, using 1 SGD = 0.75 USD in 2025).
- **Technology Professional**: S$1.54M–S$1.74M (~$1.16M–$1.31M USD).
- **U.S. vs. Singapore**:
  - **U.S. Wealth Higher**: U.S. professionals accumulate more wealth ($2.06M–$2.23M vs. $1.16M–$1.39M) due to higher salaries and bonuses, especially in banking. Tech salaries in the U.S. (e.g., Silicon Valley) often include stock options, boosting wealth.
  - **Taxes**: Singapore’s lower tax rates (7–15% vs. 20–35% in the U.S.) allow higher take-home pay, but U.S. salaries are generally higher, offsetting this.
  - **CPF vs. 401(k)**: Singapore’s mandatory CPF (~$300k) provides a stable, low-risk asset, but U.S. 401(k)s ($440k) can grow faster if invested aggressively.
  - **Housing Costs**: U.S. housing costs are higher in tech/finance hubs (e.g., $800k–$1.5M vs. S$600k–S$800k for Singapore HDB flats), but home equity growth is similar.
  - **Lifestyle**: U.S. professionals face higher healthcare and education costs, potentially reducing savings compared to Singapore’s subsidized systems.

### U.S. Context
- **Average Net Worth**: In 2022, the average U.S. household net worth was $1.06M, with medians much lower ($192,700). For ages 45–54 (likely after 20 years of work), the average is $975,800, and for 55–64, it’s $1.57M. Banking and tech professionals, as high earners, typically exceed these averages.[](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/what-is-the-average-american-net-worth-by-age)[](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/average-net-worth-by-age)
- **Top Performers**: Elite bankers (e.g., managing directors) or tech professionals (e.g., at FAANG companies) can accumulate $5M–$10M+ if they secure large bonuses or equity grants.
- **Economic Factors**: U.S. markets offer strong investment opportunities, but volatility (e.g., 2008 crisis) can impact wealth. High inflation (~3–4% recently) erodes purchasing power.

### Final Estimate
After 20 years, a U.S. banking professional might accumulate **$2.0M–$2.5M** in net worth, and a technology professional **$1.8M–$2.3M**, assuming moderate savings, prudent investments, and homeownership. Top performers could reach $5M–$10M, while high spenders or those with debt may fall below $1M.

### Caveats
- **Data Limitations**: Salary data from 2023–2025 may not fully reflect 2005–2025 trends. I used conservative growth rates and returns.
- **Variability**: Wealth varies by role (e.g., fintech vs. retail banking), location (e.g., New York vs. smaller cities), and personal choices.
- **Economic Risks**: Recessions, layoffs, or medical expenses can reduce wealth.

If you provide details (e.g., specific role, location, or savings habits), I can refine the estimate further!
