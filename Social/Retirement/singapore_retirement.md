>> We take the safety for granted. Your family members can walk outside alone at 1am and it’s still safe. The food is cheap, infrastructure is good, governmental services while slow is much faster compared other countries. I quite love Singapore and haven’t found somewhere better yet.

>> I like that I only need 1 wardrobe the whole year and the clothes take up very little space; the humidity is uncomfortable but it make skin look young longer. Utilities prices and food prices are low compared to other developed countries so I can just turn on the aircon whenever I want to. English can be used for all documents, transactions and interactions (with sellers, police, health care professionals, lawyers, etc). I love availability of food and delivery services at any time of the day or night. The most important point is the availability of local and international food here. The range of food flavours is the widest in the world. International food is generally close enough to the original. Local food is cheap and faster than fast food. Probably the shortest wait in the world for (local) coffee and tea.


>> As a citizen, your access to high quality yet affordable healthcare is a critical consideration at the latter stages of life.

Stay in singapore , get a smaller house when kids marry, eat cheap or go JB for good meals.

Why? Safety, quality healthcare , sound government , convenience to travel overseas for holidays, friends here, family here, great transport system, convenience in reaching any ntuc, sheng siong, giant, bubble tea ( lol), hawker food .

You can't beat out SG in terms of safety, infrastructure, ease of access to things etc. Sure you can take things slow when you're older, but you still wouldn't want to be stuck traveling for an hour to get to places. 

### Retirning in subburbs not so good
I used to want to retire in more suburban areas but after living in US and talking to locals with elderly family members, I realize that it’s really difficult to stay in foreign suburbia if you don’t have a good close-knit support structure (esp. younger folks).

Heck, even I as an adult think suburbia is very mafan. You want to go Shop A from Shop B, sometimes you need to drive 1-2 minutes (or walk 15) because of how spread apart they are.

A lot of older folks depend on their children/grandchildren to bring them around town because by the time you’re 70-80, it can get difficult to drive. Not to mention if you have health problems and need to go clinic, no safe and reliable (compared to 1 every hour in US) MRT/bus to rely on, paratransit isn’t reliable and taking taxi/PHV is going to be a massive drain.

I’m not so sure what my retirement plan is, especially in my golden years, but suffice to say, if I have mobility issues, rural/suburban areas won’t be as appealing/charming as imagined.

### Against

From 55-70 I'll probably rent out our house in SG and travel the world until I've health problems or mobility issues. Staying put in a city for 4-6 months each time. Then when health issues become more and more severe or if I need longer term care, I'll come back and live out the remainder of my life here.
