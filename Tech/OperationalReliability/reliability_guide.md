* A Reliability Framework
* A GitHub Repo Structure
* A Practical User Guide


---

# 🎯 Goal

Create a repo that:

* Removes memory dependency during incidents
* Forces pre-deployment failure modeling
* Evolves after every incident
* Is solo-dev friendly but SRE-grade in thinking

---

# 🏗 High-Level Architecture

You are building:

> **Production Reliability Operating System (PROS)**

It has 5 pillars:

1. Operational Readiness Review (Before Deployment)
2. Failure Mode Library
3. Runbooks (Actionable Steps)
4. Incident Logs + Postmortems
5. Continuous Reliability Improvement

This becomes your **operational memory system**.

# 📘 USER GUIDE

Below is your structured user guide.

---

# 1️⃣ Foundations

## reliability_principles.md

Core philosophy:

* Humans fail under stress
* Incidents are unmodeled failure modes
* Every incident must improve system resilience
* Recovery must not require tribal knowledge
* Automation > memory

---

# 2️⃣ Operational Readiness (Before First Deployment)

## pre_deployment_checklist.md

Every service must answer:

### Observability

* [ ] Metrics exposed?
* [ ] Health endpoint?
* [ ] Structured logs?
* [ ] Alerts defined?

### Recovery

* [ ] Can rollback be done in < 10 minutes?
* [ ] Restart procedure documented?
* [ ] Stateful vs stateless behavior defined?

### Failure Modeling

* [ ] Memory exhaustion modeled?
* [ ] Network partition considered?
* [ ] Dependency outage simulated?
* [ ] Disk full scenario tested?

No service goes to prod without this.

---

# 3️⃣ Failure Library (Data Engineering Specific)

This is not reactive.
This is proactive modeling.

Example: `spark_failures.md`

| Failure Mode          | Detection            | Immediate Action   | Long-Term Fix             |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Driver OOM            | Driver logs          | Restart driver     | Tune memory / reduce skew |
| Executor skew         | Stage time imbalance | Check task metrics | Repartition data          |
| Checkpoint corruption | Job restart fails    | Clear checkpoint   | Harden checkpoint logic   |

You’re building a catalog of predictable disasters.

---

# 4️⃣ Runbooks (Zero-Thinking Execution)

Each runbook must have:

```
## Symptom
What user sees

## Quick Diagnosis (5 min path)
Commands to run

## Deep Diagnosis
Advanced checks

## Mitigation
Immediate stabilizing action

## Escalation
When to call infra/db/network

## Related Incidents
Links to past failures
```

Example snippet:

```
kubectl get pods -n prod
kubectl describe pod <pod>
kubectl logs <pod> --previous
```

No guessing.

---

# 5️⃣ Incident Log (Blameless Postmortem)

Each incident file:

```
## Incident ID
## Severity
## Start Time
## End Time
## MTTR

## Timeline

## Root Cause

## Why Detection Failed

## What Runbook Was Missing

## Permanent Fix

## Runbook Updated? (Y/N)
```

Rule:

> If runbook was missing, add it before closing incident.

---

# 6️⃣ Scripts Folder (Automation Layer)

Goal:

Reduce cognitive load.

Examples:

* `check_cluster.sh`
* `get_spark_executors.py`
* `check_kafka_lag.sh`
* `dump_db_connections.sql`

Your future self should never type complex queries from memory.

---

# 7️⃣ Game Days (Advanced but Powerful)

Quarterly:

* Kill Spark driver
* Block S3 access
* Increase Kafka load artificially
* Fill disk to 95%

Observe:

* Did alert fire?
* Did engineer freeze?
* Did runbook work?

Refine system.

---

# 8️⃣ Metrics to Track (Maturity Indicator)

Track:

* MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)
* MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
* % incidents with updated runbook
* % incidents auto-detected vs user-reported

If user-reported is high → observability weak.

---

# 9️⃣ Personal Reliability Framework (Solo Dev Version)

Since you sometimes work independently:

Adopt a simplified rule:

After any production issue:

1. Create incident file.
2. Add detection rule.
3. Add runbook step.
4. Add automation script if possible.

Within 6 months your repo becomes extremely powerful.

---

# 🔟 How This Scales If You Build a Startup

This repo becomes:

* Onboarding tool
* DevOps maturity signal
* Investor confidence artifact
* Reduced key-man risk

---

# 🧠 Deep Insight

What you’re building is:

> Externalized working memory for production cognition.

Instead of:
“Hope I remember what to do.”

You create:
“System tells me what to do.”

This is how elite reliability orgs think.

---

# 🔥 If You Want Next Level

We can extend this into:

* Reliability maturity levels (L1–L5)
* Data pipeline specific reliability model
* Automated runbook execution engine
* ChatOps integration model
* AI-assisted incident triage system (which fits your agentic thinking)

---

If you want, next I can:

1. Design a Spark/Kafka/Iceberg-specific failure modeling template
2. Or design a minimal version optimized for a 1–3 engineer team
3. Or design this as a productized internal tool idea

Which direction?
