Java has several "gotchas" that can catch even seasoned developers by surprise if they aren’t aware of them. 

# Advanced

### 1. jdbc driver getObject() 
Some DBs/drivers default to text protocol on the wire, so they naturally parse to String unless you ask for a numeric type. 

getObject() is driver-dependent. A SMALLINT can come back as a String, and if you treat that as “a 2-byte number,” you’ll get type bugs, wrong ordering, bigger payloads, and slower queries. Always use getShort() or getObject(col, Short.class), and normalize/validate at system boundaries.

Great catch. Here’s what’s going on and why it bites people.

#### What’s the gotcha?

* **SQL `SMALLINT` is 16-bit signed** (−32,768…32,767) on the database. But **JDBC doesn’t guarantee the Java type** you get back from `ResultSet.getObject(int/String)`. Depending on the driver, wire protocol (text vs binary), and settings, `getObject()` may return:

  * `Short` (what you hoped for),
  * `Integer` or `BigDecimal`,
  * **or a `String` containing the digits** (e.g., `"123"`).
* If you then assume “it’s only 2 bytes,” you’re mixing up **DB storage** with **Java object representation**. `"123"` is **3 characters** (and much more than 3 bytes in memory due to `String` overhead), so you can end up with:

  * **Bigger objects**, more GC pressure,
  * **Schema/type drift** when you pass data downstream,
  * **Bugs from lexicographic vs numeric behavior**.

#### How this causes issues

1. **ClassCastException at runtime**

   ```java
   Short s = (Short) rs.getObject("age"); // boom if it’s actually a String
   ```

2. **Silent logic errors** (no exception, wrong results)

   * Sorting or comparing as strings: `"100" < "20"` lexicographically.
   * Aggregations or validations treat numbers as text (e.g., `"05"` vs `"5"`).
   * Range filters become string comparisons if you aren’t careful.

3. **Query performance regressions**

   * Passing the value back with `setObject(i, "123")` may force **implicit casts** in SQL (string→smallint), which can **defeat indexes** and hurt plans.

4. **Data pipeline & serialization mismatches**

   * ORMs/ETL layers infer column types from runtime values; if they see a `String`, your Avro/Parquet/Kafka schema may record it as `string` instead of `int16`, breaking consumers.
   * JSON payload sizes and memory footprint increase.

5. **Locale/formatting edge cases**

   * If a driver (or your code) ever formats with locale, you can get unexpected characters (rare, but another footgun).

#### Why drivers do this

* Some DBs/drivers default to **text protocol** on the wire, so they naturally parse to `String` unless you ask for a numeric type.
* Older drivers/JDBC versions (or certain configuration flags) are looser in their mappings.
* JDBC spec only says `getObject()` returns a Java object representing the column—**it doesn’t pin it to a specific numeric class**.

#### How to defend yourself (do this!)

1. **Ask for the exact type you want**

   * Prefer primitives/getters:

     ```java
     short v = rs.getShort("age");         // canonical, fast
     boolean wasNull = rs.wasNull();
     ```
   * Or JDBC 4.1+ typed `getObject`:

     ```java
     Short v = rs.getObject("age", Short.class);
     ```

2. **If you must use raw `getObject()`, normalize defensively**

   ```java
   Object o = rs.getObject("age");
   short age;
   if (o == null) {
     // handle null
   } else if (o instanceof Number) {
     age = ((Number) o).shortValue();
   } else {
     age = Short.parseShort(o.toString().trim()); // last resort
   }
   ```

3. **Check metadata when you build generic layers**

   ```java
   int sqlType = rs.getMetaData().getColumnType(colIdx); // Types.SMALLINT?
   ```

   Use it to choose the getter (`getShort`) rather than `getObject`.

4. **Be explicit in ORMs/mappers**

   * Map `SMALLINT` to `short/Short` in JPA/Hibernate (`@Column(columnDefinition="SMALLINT")` or vendor-specific dialect hints).
   * For MySQL, review connector flags (e.g., tinyint/bit behaviors) and prefer **binary protocol** if your driver supports it.

5. **Validate at boundaries**

   * When writing back, use numeric setters:

     ```java
     ps.setShort(1, age);
     ```
   * Avoid `ps.setObject(1, "123")` for numeric columns.

6. **Test with your real driver + settings**

   * Unit/integration tests that **assert the runtime Java class** returned for each column type catch these surprises early.

# Basic 

### 1. **Autoboxing and Unboxing Pitfalls**: 

When Java automatically converts between primitive types (like `int`) and their wrapper classes (`Integer`), known as autoboxing/unboxing, subtle issues can arise. For instance, comparing `Integer` objects with `==` can lead to unexpected behavior due to caching and reference comparisons instead of value comparisons. The `==` operator compares references for objects, so two `Integer` objects with the same value might not be `==` unless they're within the cached range (-128 to 127)【28†source】【30†source】.

### 2. **Floating-Point Arithmetic**: 
Floating-point operations are inherently imprecise due to their binary representation, which can lead to unexpected results in arithmetic operations. Even seemingly simple calculations, like `0.1 + 0.2`, might yield a result that isn't exactly `0.3` due to rounding errors. It’s often better to use `BigDecimal` for financial calculations to avoid such issues【31†source】.

### 3. **Mutability of `String` and `StringBuilder` Behavior**: 
Java `String` objects are immutable, meaning any modification results in a new `String` object being created. This can be a performance issue in loops or repeated concatenations. Using `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` (for thread-safe needs) is preferable in such cases. Additionally, the `intern()` method on `String` can lead to memory leaks if not used carefully, as it places strings in a pool that is difficult to reclaim until the Java process ends【29†source】.

Here’s the idea in plain terms, why it matters, and how to do it right.

##### Why `String` immutability matters

* `String` never changes after it’s created. Doing `"hi" + "!"` **creates a new object**.
* Benefits: thread-safety, easy sharing/caching (interning), safe to pass around, stable hash codes.
* Cost: lots of temporary objects if you “modify” strings repeatedly.

##### The performance trap

```java
String s = "";
for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
  s = s + i;   // creates a new String every iteration (and temp objects)
}
```

Each `+` builds a new `String` from the old contents + new piece → O(n²) behavior overall and heavy GC.

Note: For a **single** expression like:

```java
String s = a + b + c;
```

the compiler/JVM already rewrites it to use a builder under the hood. The problem is **loops** or repeated concatenations across statements.

##### Use `StringBuilder` (or `StringBuffer`) instead

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(200_000); // pre-size if you can
for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
  sb.append(i);
}
String s = sb.toString();
```

* `StringBuilder` is fast (no synchronization).
* `StringBuffer` is synchronized (thread-safe) but slower—use it **only** if multiple threads append to the same instance (rare). Most of the time, choose `StringBuilder`.

##### When the JVM helps (and when it doesn’t)

* Java 9+ uses `invokedynamic` (`StringConcatFactory`) to optimize **simple** concatenations.
* It **doesn’t** save you from the loop case: you’re still creating many intermediate strings.
* Compact Strings (Java 9+) reduce memory for Latin-1, but don’t change the immutability cost pattern.

##### Practical guidelines

* **Hot loops / large joins:** use `StringBuilder`. If you know the target size, call the constructor with a capacity to avoid growth copies.
* **Single expression concatenation:** `a + b + c` is fine.
* **Joining many items:** prefer `String.join(delim, collection)` or `Collectors.joining(delim)`—internally uses a builder.
* **Formatting:** `String.format` is readable but slower; avoid in tight loops.
* **Multithreaded mutation:** if multiple threads truly build the **same** buffer (uncommon), use `StringBuffer` or higher-level concurrency constructs. Usually it’s cleaner to build per-thread and combine.

##### Quick before/after example

**Bad**

```java
String out = "";
for (String part : parts) {
  out += "," + part;  // many temps, O(n²)
}
```

**Good**

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(parts.size() * 8); // rough guess
for (String part : parts) {
  if (sb.length() > 0) sb.append(',');
  sb.append(part);
}
String out = sb.toString();
```

##### TL;DR

* `String` is immutable → repeated concatenation creates lots of temporary objects.
* In loops or large builds, switch to `StringBuilder` (usually) or `StringBuffer` (rare, thread-shared).
* Pre-size when possible, and prefer `join`/`joining` for collections.


### 4. **Default Serialization Traps**: 
Java’s default serialization can be inefficient and can cause maintenance issues. It’s recommended to implement `Serializable` carefully, as serialization exposes private data and can lead to issues with backward compatibility if class structures change. Overriding `readObject` and `writeObject` methods is often needed to manage serialization effectively and securely【28†source】.

With Serializable, the server writes out your object’s state (class + fields) into a JVM-specific byte stream, sends it “over the wire,” and the client deserializes it back into a live object by matching class name and serialVersionUID. This was heavily used in older Java EE frameworks for RMI, EJB, session replication, and JMS because it made state transfer automatic — but today, it’s avoided in favor of schema-based, cross-language formats like JSON, Avro, or Protobuf.


### 5. **Overuse of `Finalize()` . use try with resource **: 
The `finalize()` method is not guaranteed to run in a timely manner, and it may not run at all if the object is never garbage-collected. Since Java 9, `finalize()` has been deprecated due to its unreliability. Instead, the `**try-with-resources`** statement is preferred for releasing resources like file streams or database connections

**try-with-resources** (TWR) in Java—what it is, how it works, and the gotchas to watch.

##### What it is

A `try` form (Java 7+) that **automatically closes** resources when the block exits—successfully or with an exception.
A “resource” is anything that implements **`AutoCloseable`** (e.g., `Closeable`, JDBC `Connection/Statement/ResultSet`, streams, readers, writers, `ZipFile`, etc.).

```java
try (BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
    return br.readLine();
} // br.close() is called automatically here
```

##### Why it’s better than try/finally

* **No leaks:** `close()` always runs.
* **Cleaner:** no verbose `finally` blocks.
* **Correct exception handling:** primary exceptions aren’t hidden by close failures (see “suppressed” below).

##### How it works under the hood

* At the end of the `try` block, the JVM calls `close()` on each resource **in reverse (LIFO) order** of declaration.
* If both the body and `close()` throw, the body’s exception is rethrown and the close-time exception(s) are **suppressed** and attached to the primary:

  ```java
  catch (Exception e) {
      for (Throwable t : e.getSuppressed()) { /* inspect */ }
  }
  ```

##### Multiple resources

Declare several, separated by semicolons. They will be closed in reverse order.

```java
try (
    Connection con = ds.getConnection();
    PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(sql);
    ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()
) {
    while (rs.next()) { /* ... */ }
} // closes rs, then ps, then con
```

##### Java 9 convenience

You can put an **effectively final** resource outside and use it directly:

```java
BufferedWriter bw = Files.newBufferedWriter(path);
try (bw) {                 // Java 9+
    bw.write("hello");
}
```

##### Implementing your own resource

Anything with `close()` works:

```java
class TempFile implements AutoCloseable {
    private final Path p = Files.createTempFile("x","y");
    public Path path() { return p; }
    @Override public void close() throws IOException { Files.deleteIfExists(p); }
}

try (TempFile tmp = new TempFile()) { /* use tmp.path() */ }
```

##### Common use cases

* **JDBC:** `Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`
* **I/O:** `FileInputStream`, `BufferedReader/Writer`, `ZipFile`
* **Streams:** `Files.newInputStream`, `Files.lines(path)`

##### Gotchas & tips

* **Close order matters:** Declare inner/narrow resources later so they close first (JDBC example above is correct).
* **Don’t keep references** to resources outside the block; they’ll be closed.
* **`AutoCloseable` vs `Closeable`:** both work. `Closeable.close()` throws `IOException`; `AutoCloseable.close()` can throw `Exception`. Prefer `Closeable` for I/O types so callers don’t catch overly broad exceptions.
* **Suppressed exceptions**: always check `e.getSuppressed()` in diagnostics/logging; they contain failures from `close()`.
* **Performance:** negligible overhead vs manual try/finally; the main win is correctness/readability.
* **When not to use:** when the resource must remain open **beyond** the block (e.g., returning an open stream/reader). In that case, the caller should own/close it.

##### Equivalent (what the compiler would write)

This…

```java
try (InputStream in = Files.newInputStream(p)) {
    // use in
}
```

…roughly expands to:

```java
InputStream in = Files.newInputStream(p);
Throwable primary = null;
try {
    // use in
} catch (Throwable t) {
    primary = t; throw t;
} finally {
    if (in != null) {
        if (primary != null) {
            try { in.close(); } catch (Throwable sup) { primary.addSuppressed(sup); }
        } else {
            in.close();
        }
    }
}
```

That’s the essence: **declare resources in the try header, use them, and let Java close them safely—always.**


### 6. **Type Erasure with Generics**: 
Java generics use type erasure, which removes generic type information at runtime. This means that certain type checks (like checking if an object is an instance of a parameterized type) are not possible. For example, you can’t directly check if an `Object` is an instance of a generic type like `List<Integer>`. Additionally, this can cause issues with method overloading, as methods that differ only in generic parameters will cause a compile-time error【29†source】【31†source】.

### 7. **Concurrency and `HashMap`**: 
`HashMap` is not thread-safe, and using it in a concurrent setting can lead to infinite loops or data corruption. `ConcurrentHashMap` or `Collections.synchronizedMap` are better alternatives when thread safety is required. Similarly, common practices, like double-checked locking, are error-prone without `volatile`, due to Java’s memory model【32†source】【28†source】.

### 8. **Java ArrayLists do not shrink automatically** :
