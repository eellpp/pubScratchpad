### How do I calculate desk height in inches?

To calculate desk height in inches:  
Find your height wearing the footwear you'll be wearing at the desk in inches.  
Divide your height in inches by 2.  
Subtract 8.5 inches from the result of the previous step to find your minimum desk height.  
Subtract 6 inches from the result of Step 2 to get your maximum desk height.  
Remember, these values should only be a starting point for you. You might need to adjust your desk to sit safely and comfortably.   


### What height should my desk be if I'm 5 ft 5 in?

If you're 5 ft 5 in tall, your ideal desk should be 24-26.5 in tall. Remember that everybody's different, so this range should serve just as a starting point.

### How high should my desk be for my height?

You can adjust your desk height with the instructions:
- Use the 0.4739 × height − 6.678 formula for the minimum desk height (inches).
- Use the 0.5538 × height − 9.4270 formula for the maximum desk height (inches).

Your elbows and forearms should lie straight on the desk and armrest. Aim for an angle of 90-110° at the elbow.

Looking straight ahead, you should be looking at the top third of the monitor.
