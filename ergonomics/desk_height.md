To calculate desk height in inches:  
Find your height wearing the footwear you'll be wearing at the desk in inches.  
Divide your height in inches by 2.  
Subtract 8.5 inches from the result of the previous step to find your minimum desk height.  
Subtract 6 inches from the result of Step 2 to get your maximum desk height.
