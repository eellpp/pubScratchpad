Method:  **Brine → Sear → Cover → Uncover & crisp** flow works *beautifully* for **Kerala-style spicy chicken fry**, especially with chicken breast (which Kerala recipes traditionally don’t favor, but this makes it work).

**Issue**:  
>> first I cook them in a closed vessel with some marination. This get some water out and they appear bigger and fuller. Then I fry them in pan. But when I do this, the chicken is fried but hard inside. How to keep the chicken soft inside and crispy outside . and also keep it well cooked

The chicken looks fuller after covered cooking, but ends up hard and dry inside after frying.

**Why your current method makes chicken hard? What’s happening scientifically?** :    
Closed-vessel cooking  
- Chicken breast releases water.
- Temperature slowly rises.
- Proteins start tightening.
- Then pan-frying
- You cook it again at high heat.
- Breast meat has very little fat.

**Result**: overcooked proteins → dry, hard texture.   
Chicken breast becomes tough above ~68–70 °C.  
Once overcooked, no frying trick can make it soft again.

# Kerala Style Spicy Chicken Fry

*(Soft inside, crispy outside, well cooked)*

### Works best for:

* Chicken breast cubes or strips
* Shallow fry in pan
* Strong pepper–chilli flavor

---

## Step 1: Brine (DO NOT skip)

**Why:** Keeps breast juicy even after frying.

**Brine**

* Water – 1 litre
* Salt – 1 tbsp

👉 Soak chicken **30–45 minutes**
👉 Rinse lightly, **pat completely dry**

---

## Step 2: Kerala-style marinade (after brine)

**Marinate for 20–30 minutes**

* Kashmiri chilli powder – 1½ tsp
* Black pepper powder – 1 tsp
* Coriander powder – 1 tsp
* Turmeric – ¼ tsp
* Ginger-garlic paste – 1½ tbsp
* Lemon juice or vinegar – 1 tsp
* Salt – *very little* (brine already added salt)
* Coconut oil – 1 tsp

> ❗ No water, no yogurt here. Keep it thick.

---

## Step 3: Sear (this creates the crust)

* Heat **coconut oil** (2–3 tbsp) in wide pan
* Oil should be **hot but not smoking**
* Add chicken in **single layer**

🔥 **Medium-high heat**

* Don’t move for **1½–2 minutes**
* Flip and sear other side **1½ minutes**

👉 At this point:

* Outside: reddish-brown
* Inside: still undercooked (perfect)

---

## Step 4: Cover & cook gently (critical step)

* Reduce heat to **low**
* Sprinkle **2–3 tbsp water**
* Cover pan

⏱ Cook **6–8 minutes**, turning once

**What this does**

* Steam finishes the inside gently
* Prevents moisture loss
* Chicken stays soft

---

## Step 5: Uncover & crisp (Kerala-style fry finish)

* Remove lid
* Increase heat to **medium**
* Let moisture evaporate
* Add:

  * Curry leaves – 1 sprig
  * Crushed black pepper – ½ tsp
  * Optional: sliced shallots (small amount)

Stir-fry till:

* Oil separates
* Edges turn dark & crispy
* Chicken feels springy, not hard

---

## Final Kerala touch (optional but authentic)

Add **½ tsp roasted coconut bits** or
**½ tsp coconut oil drizzle** at the end.

---

## How to know chicken is perfect (without thermometer)

* Cut one piece:

  * Juices clear, not white
  * Inside slightly glossy, not chalky
* Press with spoon:

  * Bounces back softly, not stiff

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ Cooking in closed vessel *first*
❌ Adding water in marinade
❌ High heat throughout
❌ Too much salt after brining
❌ Overcrowding pan


Just tell me 👍
