### **Quiet Flows the Ron**

At the edge of the island, under a sky soaked in orange dusk, an old pig named Snip lay quietly beside the river Ron. His hooves were caked in dried mud, his back arched with time, and his breath was slow — but his eyes still followed the water.

The river whispered, curling gently around the island like a soft noose no one had managed to untie.

A young pig approached, his snout still shiny from a recent promotion in the Pebble Bureau.

"What are you doing out here, old one?" he asked, puzzled. "The Super Bowl’s about to start — we’ve got our best shot in decades. You’re really going to miss a once-in-a-lifetime moment?"

Snip didn't answer at first. He listened. Truly listened.

“To the Ron,” he finally said.

The young pig snorted. "It’s just a river — flowing water, nothing more. Just waves and sounds and pointless shapes."

Snip smiled faintly. "Or maybe these shapes and sounds are asking questions… or answering them. Or maybe they’re just smiling — flowing quietly, watching us rise and unravel."

The young pig shook his head and trotted off toward the center of the island, where lights flickered, slogans were shouted, and crowd hummed. Behind him, Snip closed his eyes.

And quiet flowed the Ron.

### Chapter 1

**Long ago**, before pigs learned how to build towers or elect treasurers or exchange digital mushrooms for crypto-pebbles, they lived simply. Humans tended them. The sky was open, the grass soft, and the river Ron was just a river.

Then the rains came.

The Ron rose in fury and swallowed the world they knew. When the waters calmed, the village was an island. The humans were gone. The pigs were alone.

At first, they mourned. Then came Gruf — the boar who brought order.

Under Gruf’s rule, pigs built. Walls, rules, roles. And when the rules turned rigid and the roles turned cruel, some pigs left and started new groups.

One group voted. Another shared everything. A third lived in silence and deep thought. Many more followed.

Leaders emerged in each group. And with time, their message evolved:

> “We were born here. We rise here. Serving the community is all that matters.”

And yet, pigs saw that those who rose fastest did not do so by serving — but by **gaining**. Power. Capital. Prestige.

Pebbles became tokens. Tokens became accounts. Accounts became status. Jobs became brands. Branded pigs were celebrated; unbranded pigs cleaned the streets.

The barn — once made of mud and thatch — became a glittering metropolis. Neon vines curled around steel beams. Machines harvested food. Towers of glass reached toward a sky no longer watched.

Science and technology advanced. Pigs wore headsets that simulated flying over Ron. Algorithms decided who got promoted. Pigs measured one another in metrics and dashboards, until even snorts and grunts were scored.

The Thinkers — once revered — were now oddities. Their slow, uncertain questions had no place in a world that rewarded fast answers and faster profits.

And so, over generations, pigs stopped asking, *What lies beyond the Ron?*

The Ron became myth, then nuisance, then invisible.

Most pigs lived consumed by the rhythm of the city: survive, serve, outpace, outperform. Debates, hierarchies, promotions, frictions — life was a spinning wheel, and no one had time to wonder what stood outside its rim.

But every now and then...

A pig wandered toward the water. Not out of rebellion — just fatigue. Or silence. Or a strange tug in the belly they didn’t understand.

And when they sat by the edge of the Ron, the current seemed to shift — just slightly. As if the river leaned in, curious.

A question might rise.

A memory might flicker.

Or maybe nothing would happen at all — just the feeling that the Ron knew something it wasn’t telling.

Maybe the Ron was asking questions.

Maybe it was answering.

Maybe it was doing both.

Maybe it was just smiling — amused at how far the pigs had come and how far they had drifted.


And still...
quiet flowed the Ron.

### Chapter 2

The pigs had harnessed clean energy, built AI-driven ethics councils, and traded in quantum pebbles. Their cities gleamed — towers of glass, streets that spoke, skies dotted with surveillance drones disguised as birds. Algorithms managed their economy with breathtaking precision, predicting needs before they were felt.

And yet, beneath this glittering order, something remained unsettled.

The pigs still felt hollow. Still struggled. Still clawed their way up the steep echelons of society. A few reached the summit — often at great personal cost — while the rest burned out, trampled in the climb. The cycle persisted: ambition, exhaustion, collapse.

Some, unwilling to accept this as natural, turned inward. They questioned the meaning of it all. A handful published long, intricate theories on the origins of mass suffering — essays full of charts and complex maps — but their ideas were debated briefly and forgotten amid the rush of daily survival.

Progress thrived. But peace never came.

In the great academies, young scientists whispered:

“Our telescopes show the planet is covered in liquid — Ron is just one flow among millions. We revolve around a star, in a galaxy of stars. There are other planets. Maybe… maybe we should go there. Maybe we'll be happy there.”

Their professors listened. One, a deeply respected academic elder, simply nodded.

Then, one afternoon, without a word, he rose from his lecture podium and walked into the restricted wing of the Archives — a vault few knew existed. The young scientists followed quietly.

He opened a long-sealed drawer. Inside were paper notes, faded with age.

“These…” he whispered, “…are from long before our time. From when humans still walked this planet. Before the flood. Before the Ron turned this into an island.”

He laid the papers out.

“They wrote of farms… and pigs. Not unlike us. The humans built cities. They built economies. They unlocked the secrets of matter. And yet, they asked the same questions we do now — Why do we suffer? What is the point? Where is peace?"

He fell silent, the rustle of Ron barely audible through the distant windows.

Then, he turned his back to the room and walked slowly to the great glass window that looked toward the distant flow of the Ron — still winding its way along the horizon, unchanged.

He said nothing more.

The young pigs stood there in uneasy silence. Then one by one, frustrated, they left.

That night, one of them — the same curious pig who had questioned Snip — woke with a start.

In his dream, the Ron had risen — not in violence, but in magnificence. It thundered like thought itself. It had no voice, but it spoke. It had no eyes, but it watched. It asked questions not with words, but with motion.

He sat up, breath shallow, heart pounding.

All was still.

Just wind. Just quiet. The dream was gone. The city still hummed.

And yet... something had shifted.

He now understood why the elder had turned his back to them and stared silently at the river.

The solution they were chasing was the very problem.

They had sought to escape pain and sorrow as if these were solvable equations in the complicated system. But pain, like joy, was simply what happened when something existed. Existence itself was not broken. It just was. Happiness. Pain. Struggle. Wonder. They weren’t problems to solve — they were side effects of being.

He felt no despair. Only stillness. Only truth.

A deep urge pulled him from bed. Slowly, barefoot, he walked through the quiet streets. Past glowing signs. Past silent factories. Past the metropolis which glistened in their burning ambitions.

He walked toward the edge of the island — toward the river Ron.

It shimmered in the moonlight, flowing like it always had. Not caring. Not judging. Not offering solutions. Just… being.

He stepped to the edge. He let the water touch his hooves. Then his legs. Then his chest.

And he stood there — letting the river flow over him, on him, through him.

The Ron neither welcomed nor rejected him.

It simply flowed. 

And so, quiet flows the Ron.
