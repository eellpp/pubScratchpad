### **Quiet Flows the Ron**

At the edge of the island, under a sky soaked in orange dusk, an old pig named Snip lay quietly beside the river Ron. His hooves were caked in dried mud, his back arched with time, and his breath was slow — but his eyes still followed the water.

The river whispered, curling gently around the island like a soft noose no one had managed to untie.

A young pig approached, his snout still shiny from a recent promotion in the Pebble Bureau.

"What are you doing out here, old one?" he asked, puzzled. "The Super Bowl’s about to start — we’ve got our best shot in decades. You’re really going to miss a once-in-a-lifetime moment?"

Snip didn't answer at first. He listened. Truly listened.

“To the Ron,” he finally said.

The young pig snorted. "It’s just a river — flowing water, nothing more. Just waves and sounds and pointless shapes."

Snip smiled faintly. "Or maybe these shapes and sounds are asking questions… or answering them. Or maybe they’re just smiling — flowing quietly, watching us rise and unravel."

The young pig shook his head and trotted off toward the center of the island, where lights flickered, slogans were shouted, and crowd hummed. Behind him, Snip closed his eyes.

And quiet flowed the Ron.

**Long ago**, before pigs learned how to build towers or elect treasurers or exchange digital mushrooms for crypto-pebbles, they lived simply. Humans tended them. The sky was open, the grass soft, and the river Ron was just a river.

Then the rains came.

The Ron rose in fury and swallowed the world they knew. When the waters calmed, the village was an island. The humans were gone. The pigs were alone.

At first, they mourned. Then came Gruf — the boar who brought order.

Under Gruf’s rule, pigs built. Walls, rules, roles. And when the rules turned rigid and the roles turned cruel, some pigs left and started new groups.

One group voted. Another shared everything. A third lived in silence and deep thought. Many more followed.

Leaders emerged in each group. And with time, their message evolved:

> “We were born here. We rise here. Serving the community is all that matters.”

And yet, pigs saw that those who rose fastest did not do so by serving — but by **gaining**. Power. Capital. Prestige.

Pebbles became tokens. Tokens became accounts. Accounts became status. Jobs became brands. Branded pigs were celebrated; unbranded pigs cleaned the streets.

The barn — once made of mud and thatch — became a glittering metropolis. Neon vines curled around steel beams. Machines harvested food. Towers of glass reached toward a sky no longer watched.

Science and technology advanced. Pigs wore headsets that simulated flying over Ron. Algorithms decided who got promoted. Pigs measured one another in metrics and dashboards, until even snorts and grunts were scored.

The Thinkers — once revered — were now oddities. Their slow, uncertain questions had no place in a world that rewarded fast answers and faster profits.

And so, over generations, pigs stopped asking, *What lies beyond the Ron?*

The Ron became myth, then nuisance, then invisible.

Most pigs lived consumed by the rhythm of the city: survive, serve, outpace, outperform. Debates, hierarchies, promotions, frictions — life was a spinning wheel, and no one had time to wonder what stood outside its rim.

But every now and then...

A pig wandered toward the water. Not out of rebellion — just fatigue. Or silence. Or a strange tug in the belly they didn’t understand.

And when they sat by the edge of the Ron, the current seemed to shift — just slightly. As if the river leaned in, curious.

A question might rise.

A memory might flicker.

Or maybe nothing would happen at all — just the feeling that the Ron knew something it wasn’t telling.

Maybe the Ron was asking questions.

Maybe it was answering.

Maybe it was doing both.

Maybe it was just smiling — amused at how far the pigs had come and how far they had drifted.

And still...
quiet flowed the Ron.
